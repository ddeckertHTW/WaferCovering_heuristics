# WaferCovering_Heuristics
This is the git repository for the article "Heuristic Approaches to the Wafer Covering Problem." This repository has the following structure:

  + *DATA*: This folder contains all results from algorithm runs.
  + *Greedy_Optimized*: This folder contains the current version of the greedy implementation.
  + *GeneticAlgorithm*: This folder contains the implementation of the genetic algorithm.
  + *GlobalConstants.py*: This file contains additional constants controlling the greedy algorithm.
  + *inputMapsLibary.py*: This file contains references to all wafer maps of the reference problem suite. The referenced objects are defined in the *Data_Template* subfolder. 
  + *probecardLibary.py*: This file defines all probe card shape of the reference problem suite.

All other files are included for completeness and should not be of further interest.
